## About <a name = "about"></a>

This was my first experiment with React Native. This is a game about making cookies. 
<br />
There are farms:
* Peanut farm
* Cacao Beans farm
<br />
There is a bakery with 3 types of cookies you can bake.
<br />
There is a shop, where you can buy various types of cookies, or exchange farmed goods for cookies.
<br />
There is a level system. Can you try to reach level 10?

# Welcome to my game ðŸ‘‹

This is an interesting, chill game about creating cookies. The game has: cacao and peanut farms, bakery, shop and e.t.c. Better check it out yourself ðŸ˜‰

## The purpose of my application: 

My first goal was just to learn something new, then I really liked the idea and decided to make this game as a work in my portfolio. This was my first React Native project.

## Also: 

* A good game to play on a metro ride
* A template and example of usage of React Native for people who look for a code to check out (if you have any questions regarding the code @andrinoff on all social media)


## Made by andrinoff (Andrey Smirnoff) using:

* Expo
* React Native
* Typescript
